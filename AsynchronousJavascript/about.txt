synchronous code is easy to understand 
one pieoce of code executes before the next piece start 

the code is blocking anything from happening 

non-blocking call avoids anything from hapepning 

asynchrounous : let it run and other will continue 

why would anyone write this code until we get a response 

The one reason is to respond until user responds 

If we could allow other parts to execute and run while we are wating 

we will look at patterns about how to do async coding 

setTimeout() allows other things to run while other things is required
